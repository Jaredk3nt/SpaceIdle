# Space Idle

> Name TBD

A sci-fi idle game where you man a self-sustainable space ship. Your goal is to upgrade your ship and your advance your crew.

## Skills

### Surveying

Handled by your navigator crewmate. You spend time searching for new areas for your ship. Areas are planets, or asteroids, or even open space that contain something. A area could have a random drop ("You find some salvage") an area with a new mining source, or an area with new bounties.

### Mining

Handled by your miner crewmate. You can mine any of the resources you have the correct drill for and have discovered a area.

When your miner has mined enough their mining raing goes up giving them XP for their next certification. Certifications go from F - SSS (triple S) which each open a new drill that your miner can use and equip on the ship. A new drill will allow you to mine the next type of ore.

#### Resources

Resources are used when commissioning new drills, cannons or survey equipment along with the requisite cost in credits.

Ordered from lowest level drill required to highest.

### Combat

Handled by the admiral crewmate. You can engage in fighting with bounties from areas you have discovered. Bounties are an enemy type which have a price on their head, these could include gangs, militias, or pirates known in the area.

When you complete enough successful fights your admiral's combat rating goes up giving them XP for the next gun license. Gun licenses go from F - SSS (triple S) which each open a new pool of cannons to buy and equip on your ship.

Your combat abilities are determined by hull type (improvements increase health) and cannons (improvments increase max damage, accuracy etc) which can be upgraded .
